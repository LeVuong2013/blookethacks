Q: How do I run the code?

A: There are two main ways to run the code on this repository. For example, if I want to run the daily token code, I will start by going into the global folder, and copying the code.

Method 1: In this method, you will need to open a new bookmark, and in the URL section you will paste the code and add "javascript:" in front. So I would type "javascript: fetch("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/glixzzy/blooket-hack/main/global/addTokens.js").then((res) => res.text().then((t) => eval(t)))" into the URL section. You can name the bookmark whatever you please, it has no effect on the code. To run the bookmark, simply click the bookmark on the desired page.

Method 2: In this method, you will need to open inspect element. Paste the desired code into the console, and hit enter to run. Screen Shot 2021-10-07 at 6 24 23 PM Screen Shot 2021-10-07 at 6 25 03 PM

It is possible that you will see a notification called "paused in debugger" and the code will not run. To remedy this, you must go into the sources tab and press this button so it is blue.

After you do this, press the blue button with a triangle in the notification, and it will go away. Then you can do the steps outlined above and it will run.

Q: The all permanent blooks isn't working!

A: Yes, it was a joke and does not permanently work.

Q: Is there any way to bypass the 500 token per day limit or change the time before reset timer?

A: Nope! This is simply not possible, because it is server-side.

Q: Can I make my custom blook skins and use them?

A: No, this is also currently not possible.

Q: Ahhh! My account was banned! Was I just banned for hacking blooket?

A: Probably not, this is a bug that is going around that doesn't let you in your account for a short period of time. The best thing to do is just wait it out.
